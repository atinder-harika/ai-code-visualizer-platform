🚀 AI Code Visualizer Platform (M1-M6 Integration)The top-level orchestration and system architecture repository for the full-stack, microservice-based application. Demonstrates end-to-end delivery of a Generative AI product.<div align="center"><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In%2520Development-blue" /><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/Focus-System%2520Design%2520%257C%2520Microservices-red" /></div>💡 Project OverviewThis repository aggregates all modules (M1-M6) of the AI-Powered Code Visualization Platform. The system's purpose is to ingest raw code, analyze its structure, generate a pedagogical narrative using the Gemini API, and visualize the execution flow in a web/mobile studio.This project validates proficiency in system architecture, full-stack integration, event-driven design (Kafka), and cloud deployment (AWS/Terraform).⚙️ Core Technology StackCategoryTechnologyRationaleBackend/CoreJava (Spring Boot), Python (FastAPI)Used for high-performance analysis (Java) and serverless AI orchestration (Python).Frontend/UIAngular, React (M1 Dashboard), Ionic/CapacitorSelected for full-stack control, mobile-readiness, and efficient, responsive data visualization.DevOps/CloudTerraform, AWS EKS/RDS, Docker, GitHub ActionsUsed for automated, secure infrastructure provisioning (IaC) and enterprise-grade CI/CD pipelines.Data/MessagingPostgreSQL, Kafka/KinesisSelected for durable storage and high-throughput, asynchronous communication between microservices.🔑 Key Technical DeliverablesOrchestrated a four-tier microservice architecture using API Gateway patterns and Kafka streaming for real-time data flow between the Java Analyzer, Python AI service, and front-end APIs.Implemented comprehensive Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform to provision the entire AWS environment, ensuring reliable, reproducible deployments.Designed a monitoring strategy (M1 Dashboard) to track the health, latency, and throughput of all individual microservices and the core Kafka stream.📌 Roadmap Status (Self-Tracked)MilestoneStatusDetailsM1: React Health Dashboard⚪ To DoInitial monitoring UI framework setup.M2: Terraform IaC Provisioner⚪ To DoAWS VPC and base RDS/EKS infrastructure definition underway.M3: CI/CD Platform Integration⚪ To DoTemplate CI/CD pipeline defined and ready for service integration.M4: Java Concurrent Analyzer⚪ To DoFocusing on core Java concurrency logic.M5: Generative AI Service⚪ To DoDefining the Gemini API orchestration logic via Python.M6: Final Studio UI⚪ To DoAngular UI/UX design started.
